## hexo-theme-doc
Sample theme to learn working with themes in Hexo.
- Repository: https://github.com/zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc-seed
- Instructions: https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/get-started.html

To quickly bootstrap a documentation website, we have setup this example seed project that can be cloned and used a starting point.

Clone the seed project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc-seed.git
```
Go into the resulting directory and install the dependencies
```
$ cd hexo-theme-doc-seed && npm install
```
Start the preview server
```
$ hexo s
```
This command will run a built-in http server and watch for changes.

If you open your browser to http://localhost:4000 you should see the documentation website up and running.
Nice! Now you can start writing your contentâ€¦ have fun!
